# FantasticStories
"Nowa Fantastyka" is the oldest Polish SF and fantasy magazine. It publishes about 100 Polish and foreign stories each year.  "Fantastic Stories" is my first approach to creating an Android app that would allow to review and rate stories for the annual vote for best Polish and foreign text. In future I would like to add functionality of sharing user's reviews with other readers.
